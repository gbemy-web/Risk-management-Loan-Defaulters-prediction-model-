# Risk-management-Loan-Defaulters-prediction-model-
This project builds a **loan default prediction model** using the **Prosper Loan Dataset**. We tested **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**, selecting **XGBoost (threshold = 0.38)** for its **high recall (69.96%)** in detecting defaulters. This model helps improve **loan risk assessment** and **financial decision-making**.
